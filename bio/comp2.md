# Component 2 Notes

# Cell cycle
### Mitosis:
- Restriction checkpoint between G1 phase and S phase
- Chromatin = threadlike DNA in a non-dividing cell --> more efficient division
- Occurs so that each new daughter cell has a nucleus with a complete set of chromosomes


### Prophase:
- Chromosomes condense
- Nuclear envelope and nucleolus disappears
- Centrioles move to opposite sides of nucleus
- Spindle fibres form

### Anaphase:
- Centromere divides in two
- Attached microtubules contract
- Pull chromatids to opposite poles of the cell --> chromosomes
- Centromere first

### Cytokinesis:
- Plant cells vesicles form cell plate --> new cell wall
- Returns to interphase

### Meiosis:
- Homologous chromosomes pair up
- Crossing over occurs and chiasmata form

### Early prophase I:
- Homologous pair of chromosomes come together
- to form a bivalent = synapsis

### Late prophase I:
- Crossing over between non-sister chromatids in the bivalent
- Recombination of maternal and paternal genetic information

### Metaphase I:
- Spindle fibres attach to centromere
- move the chromosome to equatorial plate
- Homologous chromosomes assorted randomly at equator

### Telophase:
- Each nucleus contains half the number of original chromosomes
- Chromosomes genetically different than in original cell

### Metaphase II:
- Genetic variation by the random assortment of chromatids at the equator

#
# Human reproduction
### Male secretions:
- Prostate alkaline secretion aids in sperm mobility
- Seminal vesicle nutrients for sperm mobility

### Sequence of division for sperm:
- Spermatogonium -M + growth->
- Primary spermatocyte (D) -MI-> 
- secondary (H) -MII-> 
- haploid spermatids -differentiate->
- spermatozoa with midpiece + tails

### Fallopian tubes:
- Ends in finger like projections
- which collect the oocyte following ovulation

### Formation of secondary follicles:
- Oogonia multiply -M-> -PI-|
- primary oocytes -follicle cell coating->
- primary follicles -FSH in puberty-> |-MI-> secondary follicle

### Removal of cholesterol in sperm membrane:
- Weakens membrane
- Increases permeability to Ca++ -->
- increased tail activity +
- beginning of acrosome reaction

### Fertilisation:
- Must happen between 12-24 hours after ovulation
- Entry of head stimulates completion of MII -->
- Cortical granules release enzymes that change structure of zona pellucida

### Trophoblast functions:
- trophoblast --> chorion --> hCG for maintaining CL in first 16 weeks
- trophoblastic villi penetrate endometrium + increase surface area (?)
- --> larger chorionic villi

### Placenta roles:
- Takes over from corpus luteum
- Barrier to high bp (pre-eclampsia), pathogens (rubella) + toxins (heroin)
- Only allows passage of maternal antibodies --> passive immunity

### Amnion:
- Membrane derived from inner cell mass in blastocyst
- Amniotic fluid accumulates after 4-5 weeks

### Amniotic fluid roles:
- Maintain temperature
- Provide lubrication
- Contribute to lung development
- Allow movement
- Shock absorption

### Progesterone in pregnancy:
- with oestrogen inhibit LH + FSH release --> stop follicle maturation
- suppresses uterine contraction

### Oestrogen in pregnancy:
- stimulates growth of uterus --> accommodate foetus
- growth and development of mammary glands
- secondary sexual characteristics
- inhibit prolactin synthesis
- inhibit oxytocin synthesis

### Effects of slight progesterone decrease: 
- secretion of oxytocin from pPG to start positive feedback loop
- secretion of prolactin from aPG to stimulate milk synthesis in mammary glands
- oxytocin causes muscles around milk ducts to contract --> milk released

### Causes of blocked fallopian tubes:
- Chlamydia
- endometriosis

### IVF procedure:
- Specific dose of hormones induces multiple follicles to develop
- Oocytes located using ultrasound and collected using vaginal tube
- Following petri dish fertilisation max 2 reintroduced into uterus

### Release of FSH:
- Hypothalamus secretes GnRH -->
- aPG secretes (LH) + FSH

### Roles of FSH
- stimulates development of primary follicles + thecal cells produce oestrogen
- stimulates thecal cells to produce oestrogen

### Oestrogen roles:
- Rebuilding of endometrium
- Inhibits FSH secretion
- Stimulates LH secretion

### LH roles:
- Positive feedback on FSH
- ovulation
- increase progesterone

### No implantation / embryo:
- FSH and LH fall --> corpus luteum degenerates
- progesterone falls so endometrium sheds
- low oestrogen no longer inhibits FSH, so restarts

### Male reproductive hormones:
- FSH + testosterone for sperm development
- LH leydig cells

#
# Plant reproduction
### Male reproductive structure:
- 4 pollen sacs in the anthers, with pollen grains inside
- Filament contains vascular structure 
- transporting sucrose and amino acids to anther

### Pollen sac structure:
- Epidermis
- fibrous layer
- tapetum = food store --> energy for future cell divisions

### Pollen grain formation:
- pollen mother cells (D) -MI-MII->
- tetrad of microspores -M-> generative nucleus + tube nucleus

### Female reproductive structure:
- Carpel comprises stigma, style, ovary
- Meiosis occurs in the ovary to produce haploid ovules

### Ovule production:
- Megaspore -MI-MII-> 4 haploid cells
- 1 haploid cell -M-M-M-> 3 antipodals, 2 polar nuclei, 2 synergids, egg cell

### Insect pollination adaptations:
- Sticky stigma to collect pollen
- Anthers positioned to rub pollen onto insects
- Pollen with bards

### Self pollination cons:
- Reduces genetic variation
- Greater chance of two undesirable alleles being brought together

### Fertilisation process:
- Plant of same species produces sugary solution for germination of pollen grain
- Hydrolases provide nutrients from digested products
- Pollen tube follows gradient of chemoattractants secreted by ovule
- Tube nucleus disintegrates as pollen tube enters through micropyle

### Cotyledons:
- Cotyledons contain plumule
- Cotyledons absorb the food stored in the endosperm

### Seed germination process:
- Water imbibed through micropyle
- cotyledons swell
- testa splits open to allow entry of more oxygen --> aerobic respiration
- Rehydration activates giberellin synthesis
- giberellin diffuses into aleurone layer
- induces synthesis of amylase (hydrolase)
- which breaks down starch to maltose
- maltose diffuses to embryo where it is used for aerobic respiration
- which fuels growth of radicle and plumule

#
# Inheritance
### Mendel's laws:
- segregation: only one pair of factors / alleles present in single gametes
- independent assortment: alleles of different genes assort independently in gamete formation

### Sex linkage:
- have their loci on the X chromosome
- allele will be expressed in male phenotype even if recessive
- cannot be passed father to son

### Interaction between genotype and environment:
- himalayan rabbit ears produce melanin below 25C
- aluminium soluble at acidic pH so binds to anthocyanin --> blue

# Variation and evolution
### Necessary conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:
- Population > 100
- Isolated population
- No selection for or against any phenotype
- Random mating throughout population
- no mutations

### Adaptive radiation of finches:
- adapted to niches via natural selection
- no interspecific competition but intraspecific as population grew
- finches adapted by feeding in different ecological niches

### Implications of a low level of diversity:
- dominance by few species
- change in one species likely to affect whole habitat
- community unstable unable to withstand change

### Phylogenetic hierarchy breakdown:
- large group of organisms split into smaller groups
- in a way that reflects evolutionary relatedness

### Domain over kingdom pros:
- shows evolutionary relatedness
- kingdom classifies all bacteria together
- broad classification allows kingdom changes

### Criteria for classification:
- internal and external structure
- rRNA, cell wall biochemistry, DNA + protein seqs
- fossil record

### Analogous characteristics:
- similar functions
- similar external form
- different internal structure + development
- no evolutionary relationship

### DNA hybridisation technique:
- Single strands from different species joined together
- degree of hybridisation is proportional to the degree of similarity
- temperature upon which DNA becomes single stranded noted
- related to n hydrogen bonds fomred between complementary base pairs

### Cytochrome C technique:
- taxonomists look for similarities in amino acid sequence of Cyt C
- the more distant the species, the more mutations have occurred to alter DNA
- more differences in amino acid sequence

### Immunological similarity:
- Serum with anti-human antibodies from rabbit added to proteins of animals
- degree of similarity correlates with precipitation

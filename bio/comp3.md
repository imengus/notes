# Component 3 notes biology

# Gas exchange
## Diffusion
### Gas diffusion pathway:
- through intracellular spaces between mesophyll cells
- dissolve in film of water covering cells

### Trachea during exercise:
- during exercise less fluid

## Gills
### Gill components:
- Filaments SA ~ gill plates
- Arch supports fillaments
- Rakers trap prey

### External gills how they work:
- Highly branched
- Short diffusion path
- Vascularised
- Movement provides water current

### Elastic fibre function in alveoli:
- Stretch when inhaling
- alveoli expand --> increase SA without them bursting
- fibres recoil to force out more air

## Ventilation
### Purpose of ventilation:
- Higher concentration of oxygen in the air of the lungs than the blood
- Lower for CO2

### Forced exhalation sequence:
- Internal intercostal muscles contract -->
- ribcage pulled down
- abdominal muscle contracts to push diaphragm upwards


# Animal transport
## Circulation
### Advantages of closed:
- Blood flow rapid + efficient
- constriction + relaxation to direct to working muscles
- more efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients. RA waste

### Circulatory system:
- carries oxygenated blood away from surface in haemoglobin to cells deep in body
- outer layer thin + moist

## Heart
### Atrial contraction sequence:
- volume decreases
- pressure increases
- blood enters ventricles down pressure gradient

### Control of cardiac cycle sequence:
- SAN initiates wave of excitation -->
- spread over atrial walls --> atrial systole
- delay through AVN for complete contraction of atria
- then bundle of His
- electrical impulse terminated when no conductive tissue

## Pigments
### Haem binding sequence:
- ppO2 increases with diffusion gradient into haemoglobin
- 1st + 2nd induce conformational change
- 4th only if large increase in ppO2
- sigmoid due to cooperative binding

### Myloglobin function:
- Intracellular oxygen storage --> hold breath

### Lugworm adaptations:
- Low metabolic rate
- very readily loads, only releases oxygen in very low ppO2
- pumps seawater through burrow


# Plant transport
## Cross sections
### Order of layers in root CS:
1. Epidermis (root haircells)
2. Cortex
3. Endodermis (casparian strip)
4. Phloem
5. Xylem

### Order of layers in stem CS:
1. Epidermis
2. Cortex
3. Sclerenchyma
4. Phloem
5. Cambium
6. Xylem
7. Pith

## Mineral flow
### Apoplast:
- soaks into cellulose fibres of epidermal and cortical cell wall
- water entering xylem raises pressure at root?

### Minerals:
- diffuse with water along apoplast pathway
- at endodermis enter symplast pathway by active transport against concentration gradient
- to by-pass Casparian strip

## Transpiration
### Transpiration:
- Continuous removal of water from top of xylem results in tension
- pulls on the xylem column and water up from roots

### Factors affecting transpiration:
- warm air has more kinetic energy and holds more water
- dry air outside leaf creates steeper diffusion gradient
- blow away saturated humid air

## Techniques
### Autoradiography:
- source and sink leaves placed firmly on photographic film for 24hrs
- presence of radioactive sugars foggs negatives

### Potometer:
- cut at an angle
- tight fit
- no air bubbles in xylem
- reservoir tap opened to return bubble to start point

## Xylem and phloem
### Tracheids:
- cells with perforated end walls
- provide support
- obstructed flow only through pits

### Vessels:
- only angiosperms
- wide cells with reduced or absent cell walls
- sideways pits in case one vessel embolised
- deposition of lignin makes impermeable so die

### Phloem structure:
- Cell walls form sieve plates through which strands of cytoplasm
- Connected to companion cell via pores
- Companion cell dense cytoplasm
- Phloem parenchyma keeps all phloem elements in place
- Phloem fibres

## Movement theories
### Mass flow theory:
- Source produces and sink removes sugars
- Water flow down water potential carries sugars to sink

### Evidence against mass flow theory:
- sieve plates would impede flow
- does not suggest role for companion cells packed with mitochondria along phloem
- sucrose and amino acids move at different ways and directions
- phloem high rate of oxygen consumption

### New theories:
- pumped out H+ re-enters companion via co-transporter with sucrose
- diffusion into sieve tube elements
- cytoplasmic streaming for bidirectional in sieve tubes
- protein filaments pass through sieve pores for different solute transport

# Nutrition:
## Human
### Saliva contains:
- Mineral salts for slight alkali (Brunners in Crypts of Lieberkuhn)
- Mucus for lubrication (Brunners)
- Lysozyme for killing bacteria

### Stomach:
- Rugae for mechanical digestion
- HCl by oxyntic activates pepsinogen from chief cells
- mucus by goblet cells

### Locations of digestion:
- dipeptidases on epithelial cell emmbrane
- disaccharides intracellularly by sucrase, maltase etc
- endo- exopeptidases secreted into gut lumen
- trypsin in duodenum post activation by enterokinase

### Absorption of substances:
- monosaccharides CT with Na+ (back out capillaries) then FD into capillaries
- amino acids into the epithelium by AT + FD
- amino acids and glucose via hepatic portal vein to liver
- diffuse then recombine into triglycerides in epithelial cells
- transported to subclavian vein to re-enter blood system at thoracic duct
- down the water potential by osmosis

### Colon residues:
- of undigested cellulose
- bacteria
- dead cells

### Function of cellulose:
- provides bulk and stimulates peristalsis

## Parasites
### Extreme conditions in gut:
- no oxygen
- extremely acidic or alkaline
- digestive juices and enzymes
- peristaltic waves and churning -->
- washed away by food and juices
- immune system of host
- death of host means parasite dies
- avoid competition with others

### Steps for survival of intestinal parasites:
- penetrate host
- attach host
- organs essential for survival
- large number of eggs
- secondary host
- resistant stages to overcome period away from hosts
- absorb pre-digested food from host

### Taenia adaptations:
- suckers and double row of curved hooks
- simple structure geared for reproduction only
- very thin and long --> large SA + SA:VR

### Steps to prevent digestion:
- thick cuticle on segemnt surfaces
- inhibitory substances on surface

## Herbivore
### Reasons for long gut:
- cellulose cell walls, more time and enzyme action
- more space to accommodate bulkier plant material

### Mutualistic bacteria:
- rumen and reticulum
- fermentation produces beta glucose and short chain fatty acids

### Sequence of digestion ruminant:
1. buccal
2. rumen: absorbs organic acids/ CO2 + CH4
3. reticulum: catches heavy/ dense feed for later rumination
-->  buccal etc
4. omasum: churn for further bacterial fermentation, absorbs water + fatty acids
5. abomasum: true stomach, dissolves minerals, kills rumen bacteria, protein digestion
7. small intestine: 

## Carnivore dentition
### Purpose of carnivore dentition:
- grip
- cut
- tear meat off prey

### Incisors function:
- small, sharp, shaped like chisels
- snip or gnaw meat off bones
- cut lumps of meat up

### Canine functions:
- long and sharp
- impale and grip prey to tear meat

### Carnassials:
- premolar + first molar
- fit together
- like scissors for snipping meat and crushing bones

### Molars and premolars:
- strong pointed cusps
- cutting and tearing meat

### Jaw movement:
- lower jaw moves vertically to prevent dislocation
- cannot chew so swallows hole
- bite strong enough to crack bones
- jaw muscles attached to grooves in skull

## Herbivore dentition
### Purpose of herbivore dentition:
- cut off grass from plant
- grind grass and smash cellulose cell walls
- release digestible plant cell contents

### Incisors:
- bite against a horny pad on upper jaw 
- snipping off vegetation

### Diastema:
- fills with extra grass so can look around

### Molars and premolars:
- ridges of cement
- prevent edges of teeth being chipped away by abrasive food
- open root cavities and good blood supply for lifelong teeth growing

# Nervous system
## Animals
### Nerve nets:
- radial symmetry
- ganglion cells connections in many directions
- sense receptors respond to limited number of stimuli

## Humans
### Nerve cells:
- receptor > co-ordinator > effector > response
- heat receptors convert stimulus into an electrochemical signal

### Potentials:
- K+ always open to allow some K+ to diffuse back out DCG
- negatively charged proteins and organic phosphates
- VGNa+ close at +40mV and K+ open

### All or nothing law:
- depolarisation of axon must exceed certain threshold value
- action potential same size and strength

### Synaptic transmission:
- neurotransmitter binds to complementary receptors on post-synaptic membrane
- choline and ethanoic acid

### Purpose of synapses:
- Impulses pass in one direction only
- allow acclimatisation to filter out low level stimuli
- allow summation

### Organophosphate insecticides:
- block acetylcholinesterase
- repeated depolarisation and firing of action potentials
- so repeated contractions of muscle -->
- depletion of ATP, paralysis, death

# Excretion
## Kidneys
### Why urea:
- ammonia so toxic has to be excreted in very dilute solution
- urea 100,000 less toxic so transported in more concentrated form

### Homeostasis purpose:
- optimal conditions for cellular reactions
- independence from environment it lives in

### Anatomy:
- bowman's capsule surrounds glomerulus
- collecting duct wider than loops

### Selective reabsorption:
- glucose/amino acid cotransport Na+
- active ion uptake eg Ca++ Cl-
- urea diffuses
- creatinine and uric acid actively secreted to lumen
- Na+ out K+ in to maintain electrical gradient

### PCT cell adaptation:
- tight junctions stop molecules diffusing between
- close association with capillaries --> Short diffusion

### Loop of Henle function:
- water moves out descending limb by osmosis directly into blood capillaries of vasa recta
- $\mathrm{Na^+ + Cl^-}$ actively pumped out $\Rightarrow$ $\downarrow\Psi_s$ in medulla 

### Key phrases:
- more permeable
- detect decrease of water potential
- more water reabsorbed

### Causes of kidney failure:
- high or low blood pressure
- infection or autoimmune
- crushing injury
- diabetes

### Aims of kidney treatment:
- reduce [toxic waste]
- regulate volume of body fluids / [solute]

### Treatments of kidney disease:
- low protein diet --> less urea formed
- drugs
- dialysis
- transplant

### Function of drugs
- Ca++ channel b dilate blood vessels so reduce bp
- beta b reduce effects of adrenalin
- angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers --> angiotensin doesn't constrict blood vessels

### Hyperkalaemia:
- heart arrhythmias
- glucose + insulin
- itnravenous Ca++ to stabilise heart muscle membranes

### Hypercalcaemia:
- cardiopathy, nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis
- oesteoclasts break down too much bone <-- bisphosphonates to increase Ca++ accumulation in bone

### Dialysis:
- from artery, passed through narrow capillaries made from selectively permeable (pores) dialysis tubing in dialysis fluid
- heparin added to prevent clotting
- fluid has same [glucose], lower [ion]
- fresh fluid constantly passes through machine --> maintain

### CAPD:
- 40 minutes after fluid drained by gravity
- liquid retention + K+ accumulation occurs
- patient must drink very little, avoid K+ foods (bananas)

### Dialysis vs CAPD:
- less regular visits to hospital
- less expensive DIY
- reduced risk of fluctuations
- more infection
- less efficient at removing salt, urea, + excess water

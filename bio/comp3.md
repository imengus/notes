# Component 3 notes biology
#
# Gas exchange
### Diffusion:
- used up by outer cells before it reaches inner
- no cell is far from the surface --> simple diffusion

### Circulatory system:
- carries oxygenated blood away from surface in haemoglobin to cells deep in body
- outer layer thin + moist

### Trachea during exercise:
- during exercise less fluid

### Gill components:
- Filaments SA ~ gill plates
- Arch supports fillaments
- Rakers trap prey

### External gills how they work:
- Highly branched
- Short diffusion path
- Vascularised
- Movement provides water current

### Elastic fibre function in alveoli:
- Stretch when inhaling
- alveoli expand --> increase SA without them bursting
- fibres recoil to force out more air

### Purpose of ventilation:
- Higher concentration of oxygen in the air of the lungs than the blood
- Lower for CO2

### Forced exhalation sequence:
- Internal intercostal muscles contract -->
- ribcage pulled down
- abdominal muscle contracts to push diaphragm upwards

### Gas diffusion pathway:
- through intracellular spaces between mesophyll cells
- dissolve in film of water covering cells

# Animal transport
### Advantages of closed:
- Blood flow rapid + efficient
- constriction + relaxation to direct to working muscles
- more efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients. RA waste

### Atrial contraction sequence:
- volume decreases
- pressure increases
- blood enters ventricles down pressure gradient

### Control of cardiac cycle sequence:
- SAN initiates wave of excitation -->
- spread over atrial walls --> atrial systole
- delay through AVN for complete contraction of atria
- then bundle of His
- electrical impulse terminated when no conductive tissue

### Haem binding sequence:
- ppO2 increases with diffusion gradient into haemoglobin
- 1st + 2nd induce conformational change
- 4th only if large increase in ppO2
- sigmoid due to cooperative binding

### Myloglobin function:
- Intracellular oxygen storage --> hold breath

### Lugworm adaptations:
- Low metabolic rate
- very readily loads, only releases oxygen in very low ppO2
- pumps seawater through burrow

# Plant transport
### Root cell features:
- cellulose cell wall freely permeable to water
- large numbers of mitochondria and protein carriers

### Order of layers in root CS:
1. Epidermis (root haircells)
2. Cortex
3. Endodermis (casparian strip)
4. Phloem
5. Xylem

### Apoplast:
- soaks into cellulose fibres of epidermal and cortical cell wall
- water entering xylem raises pressure at root?

### Minerals:
- diffuse with water along apoplast pathway
- at endodermis enter symplast pathway by active transport against concentration gradient
- to by-pass Casparian strip

### Transpiration:
- Continuous removal of water from top of xylem results in tension
- pulls on the xylem column and water up from roots

### Factors affecting transpiration:
- warm air has more kinetic energy and holds more water

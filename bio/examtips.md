# Tips for the exam

{### TYPE OF MISTAKE
> EXAMPLE FROM EXAM
- CORRECTION}


# Finalised tips:
- give buzzword reason following any statement
- include more detail than necessary as long as relevant
- re-do questions whilst keeping examiner in mind


### Too narrow description
> Preferred niche of beavers
- effect of beaver introduction on biodiversity and habitat


### Not enough buzzword vocabulary relevant to the question
> cause flooding when introduced in places susceptible to floods
- Destruction of habitats due to flooding or deforestation


### Haven't demonstrated use of data, ambiguous
> Addition of nitrogen in fertiliser has biggest effect as yield has almost doubled (5.04 > 2.92)
- Increased by 2.14
- Nitrogen ONLY


### Didn't include enough experimental detail
> weigh the mass of pots every day
- Water daily so water is changing --> must weigh DRY MASS
- Control light intensity
- Include a separate pot as a control
- repeat in different areas/ regular intervals
- eg use same area each time


### Restating the question without giving reasons
> atmospheric [CO2] risen since preindustrial times
- due to increased human population


### Not having complete argument
> selective pressures could not act, organisms could not adapt
- Some species adaptations were selected against


### Not adapting ready answer to question
> number of live bacteria in given volume
- relate the latter part to definition
- given substance / liquid


### Irrelevant extracurricular description
> Distance in stds from mean shows prob of obtaining that value by chance
- standard deviation measures spread of data about the mean


### Giving too broad a reason
> Not enough ATP produced, so insects can starve
- must relate to specific mechanism
- no ATP for active transport, muscle contraction, flight muscles etc


### Not referring to all parts of the question
- fat stores used as an energy source
- DNA more accurate 


### No comparatives
> large, largest
- larger
- best accompanied with actual quantities


### Not enough detail
- For smaller questions, make more references than necessary
- For larger ones, dump all the knowledge you know even if irrelevant


### Incorrect practical technique:
> pipette a few cm3 of content, incubate at 20 C
- pipette 1 cm3 of content and incubate at 25 C
- repeat 3x and calculate a mean


### Ready phrases from core principles:
- increased kinetic energy denatures protein
- no energy for cell division / active transport
- cannot bind with substrate
- stop enzyme hydrolysis


### For comparisons illustrate before writing down:
- no light required
- no photosystems
- use of oxygen
- production of water

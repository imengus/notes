#
# Importance of ATP 
### Glucose:
- Many enzymes
- Many intermediates
- Large polar molecule

### Chloroplasts:
- Protons accumulate in thylakoid space
- Use energy from high energy electrons from chlorophyll molecules, vs NAD FAD

#
# Respiration
### Glycolysis + Link reaction:
- In oxygen, 30-32 ATP
- NAD accepts hydrogen released by dehydrogenase --> red NAD

### Fermentation:
- 2 NAD+ --> 2 NADH to produce pyruvate, reverse for lactate
- Pyruvate decarboxylated by decarboxlase --> ethanal + red NAD --> ethanol + NAD

### Stats:
- Glycerol + ATP + NAD --> triose phosphate
- ATP in 5 carbon stage
- FAD NAD in 4 carbon stage

### Endosymbiont theory:
- cristae similar to mesosomes in bacteria
- thylakoids similar to photosynthetic membranes in bacteria
- no histones associated with DNA
- ribosomes produce enzymes
- stroma contains enzymes for calvin cycle
- proton gradient established by ? membrane

#
# Photosynthesis
### Acronyms
- SAT-PACE: Perm, Air, Cut + Epiderm transparent
- VEC: Vacuole, elongated, chloroplasts

### Chloroplast adaptations:
- Stacking of thylakoids into grana maximises light catchment
- Double membrane controls movement of substances in and out

### Photophosphorylation:
- Photoexcited electrons are emitted and passed to a high energy level --> received by electron acceptors
- Electrons pass along chain of electron carriers, generating sufficient energy to synthesise ATP by chemiosmosis
- PSII receives replacement electrons from the photolysis of water
- Hydrogen ions (and electron) reduce NADP to red NADP --> [H+] in thylakoid space decreases

### Light independent reaction:
- 6C --> 2 * GP + ATP + red NADP --> 2 * TP + ATP --> RuBP

### Engelmann's + Calvin's experiments:
- Oxygen gas waste produced by Spirogyra photosynthesis
- Motile aerobic bacteria move to choloroplast parts exposed to red + blue of spectrum
- Boiling alcohol stops all reactions in cells (why?)
- 14C compounds IDed via two way chromatography + autoradiography

### Limiting factors:
- No Mg --> chlorosis, activation of ATPase
- No N --> hindered cell division

#
# Microbiology
### Structure of bacteria:
- Murein prevents lysis in hypotonic
- Capsule for sticking and defense
- Plasmid EXTRA bacterial genes for antibiotic resistance

### Terminology:
- Staphylo = clump, strepto = chain
- Mesophiles = 37, saprotrophs = lower temperature, thermophiles..

### Gram positive:
- Thick peptidoglycan attaches to Crystal violet
- not washed out by ethanol

### Gram negaive:
- Crystal violet removed when rinsed with ethanol

### Growth media and plates:
- Broth means bacteria sink to the bottom
- Streak plate separate mixed cultures ~ separate colonies
- Spread plates for serial dilution

### Total count:
- Haemocytometer for direct counting
- Quick, several types of cells 
- Â¬differentiate alive or dead
- specialised technique to count

### Viable count:
- More than one cell give rise to colony --> underestimate
- 24 hours for visible colonies in serial dilution

### Aseptic technique:
- Roaring blue flame
- Convection current to lift air from broth

#
# Populations and Ecosystems
### Growth:
- Only a few individuals are present initially --> slow growth rate --> period of adaptation to environment
- Hydrolysing substrate to release nutrients + enzyme synthesis
- Carrying capacity doesn't apply to sealed system with no inputs

### Changes in an ecosystem:
- Species composition
- Energy flow
- Population sizes
- Biological cycles

### Density dependent factors:
- Availability of territory or shelter is a density dependent factor
- Density depedendent factor acts when population rises beyond set point
- Environmental resistance relieved below set point 

### Competition:
- Two species cannot occupy same niche in a specific habitat
- Shags and cormorants feed at different depths --> niche overlap avoidance
- P. aurelia is better adapted for this niche --> reproduces more rapidly --> takes the bulk of the nutrients

### Abundance:
- Capture mark recapture
- Kick sampling
- Feacal deposits / markings
- Line transect with quadrats = variety of species on a line

### Belt transect measures: 
- Density of chosen species - Percentage frequency
- Percentage area cover 

### Kick sampling:
- Kick sampling repeat 3 times for each river position
- Then fill white tray with contents --> identify

### Kick sampling cons:
- Many species look similar
- Cannot count number of species
- Move in the tray so count more than once
- Snapshot so needs to be repeated throughout year

### Food chain does not show:
- all the species at each trophic level
- detrivores and decomposers > biomass
- omnivores feeding at several trophic stages 

### Productivity:
- GPP / light energy = photosynthetic efficiency
- NPP = GPP - energy in respiration = 0.5 * GPP = 0.001 * global light
- Herbivores less efficient than carnivores bc cellulose / lignin

### Pyramids:
- Numbers can be inverted
- Biomass difficult to measure
- Biomass doesn't account for lifespan ~ standing crop (mass of individuals) of phytoplankton lower than zooplankton
- Energy most accurate

### Primary succession:
- Fungal hyphae in lichens grip rock + trap nutrients while algae photosynthesise
- Bare rock > Lichen > Moss > Annual herb > Perennial herb > Shrub > Forest
- Shrubs block sunlight from reaching the grasses

### Succession increases:
- Biodiversity + stability
- Vertical levels
- Woody plants
- Soil depth

### Secondary succession:
- Existing seed bank of suitable plants in fertile soil
- Root systems undisturbed plants regenerate

### Disclimax reasons:
- Fire
- Ploughing
- Mineral extraction
- Mowing
- Grazing
- Trampling

###  Preventing succession:
- Poor quality soil (edaphic)
- Fire can preserve specialised plants and animals in moors
- Grazing sheep maintain open habitats of highlands

### Carbon cycle:
- Fosillisation and limestone remove carbon from marine decay
- Radiation which reaches Earth's service is absorbed and re-emitted as longer wave radiation

### Methane from:
- rice farms
- bovine belches
- landfill

### Nitrogen cycle needed for:
- amino acids
- organic bases
- chlorophylls

### Nitrogen converting bacteria:
- Need aerated soils
- Nitrosomonas NH4 --> NO2
- Nitrobacter NO2 --> NO3

### Nitrifying bacteria:
- N2 + H2 -reduction using ATP-> NH4+
- Some amino acids diverted into phloem for plant

### Fertiliser effects:
- Run off causes algal bloom as nitrate not limiting
- Light cut off so plants die
- Saprotrophic bacteria decompose dead while aerobically respiring
- High biological oxygen demand --> biodiversity of plants and animals decreases
- Nitrates toxic in water

### Preventing agricultural side effects:
- 10m land strip next to water courses
- Leguminous crop rotation
- Ploughing to aerate but not established grassland
- Drainage systems to prevent waterlogging
- Land shouldn't be bare --> leaching

### Reasons for bogland damage:
- Peat for fuel / horticulture
- Landfill
- Afforestation
- Water abstraction
- Built development

### Effects of bogland damage:
- Butterfly species loss

#
# Human impact on the environment
### Planetary boundaries:
- We add too much nitrogen to ecosystems: 150 >> 62
- Ozone thickness is above critical limit
- Loss of bodies of water destroys fisheries and makes area more arid
- Warmer seas --> more reflective ice --> positive feedback
- Soot absorbs heat and contributes to global warming

### Uses of nanoparticles:
- Cancer therapies
- Insulating coating
- Antimicrobial

### Uses of GMOs:
- Food shortage
- Drug manufacture
- Pollution

### Effects of acidification:
- Gas exchange less efficient in fish
- Phytoplankton photosynthesis
- Mollusc shells

### Staying within boundaries:
- Farming should be concentrated in the most productive areas
- People should eat less meat
- More efficient crop plants
- Prevent a large increase in atmospheric CO2

### High risk:
- Biodiversity integrity
- Biogeochemical flows
- Land system change
- Climate change

### Low risk:
- Ozone depletion
- Ocean acidification
- Fresh water use

### Endangered species:
- Non-contiguous populations = isolated --> too little genetic diversity to ensure healthy population
- Hedgerows act as corridors --> increase biodiversity
- Plants sowed in autumn --> unsuitable height for nest building

### Conservation:
- International cooperation and legislation
- Gene (sperm / seed)  banks and breeding programs
- Species reintroduction
- Education
- Ecotourism

### Why conserve: 
- Ethical reasons, uniquenesss
- Larger gene pool for improved species survival
- Potential medical and agricultural uses

### Forest management:
- Coppicing with long rotation time for cutting poles
- Selective cutting of similar number of trees
- Optimum distance apart
- Control pests and diseases

### Overfishing:
- Fish in food chain of other fish caught so knockon effects
- Drift netting catches dolphins and tortoise
- Net size
- Quotas, exclusion zones, days at sea

### Fish farming pros:
- Fish convert food into protein more efficiently
- Greater proportion of fish bodies edible
- Lower carbon footprint

### Fish farming cons:
- Disease and pollution --> antibiotics
- Escaped mutant fish (with parasites)
- Resource use
- Mangroves damaged

### Environmental impact assessment:
- Alternatives considered
- Harms considered and mitigated

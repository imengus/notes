# Finalised tips:
- Never make knowledge up. Stick to what you know
- Overload keywords and comparisons
- bullet point information that will get marks
- always re-do calculations/equations DIFFERENTLY
- justify your mistake when changing your answer
- underline key species, commands, words etc
- diagrams. annotations

### Knowledge:
- hot solution is cooled before purified organic compound collected?
- H+ + -CN -> -COOH, also by alkaline hydrolysis
- alkene to alcohol single OH
- phenol can take on H+

### Keywords:
- More negative/exothermic
- bond, not bind
- equilibrium in redox system shifts right

### Other mistakes:
- Kp in partial pressures, single p
- CONCENTRATIONS, not moles or grams
- entropy products - reactants
- wrong standard value eg Avogadro's
- Must account for every carbon or species in reaction
- Polymer displayed
- Identify based on peaks not chemical shifts
- Condenser not water jacket
- butan / benz
- didn't draw a diagram

### Level of response:
- buzzwords
- include as much detail as possible
- bullet points
- include all structures

### Make knowledge up when unsure:
> MgCl2 white precipitate
- first make sure equation is correct
- ions rather than full compounds
- nitrogen cannot have 4 bonds

### Graphical mistakes:
- always look at axes and units
- Ea drawn from reactants to peak
- voltmeter drawn in cells
- reading spectra. Give data ranges

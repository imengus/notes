# Finalised tips:
- Never make knowledge up. Stick to what you know
- Overload keywords and comparisons
- bullet point information that will get marks
- always re-do calculations/equations DIFFERENTLY
- justify your mistake when changing your answer
- always include units next to every value

### KOBReJU acryonym
- Knowledge
- Overload
- Bullet
- RE-do
- Justify
- Units

### Keywords:
- More negative/exothermic
- bond, not bind
- equilibrium in redox system shifts right

### Other mistakes:
- Kp in partial pressures, single p
- CONCENTRATIONS, not moles
- entropy products - reactants
- wrong standard value eg Avogadro's

### Level of response:
- buzzwords
- include as much detail as possible
- bullet points

### Make knowledge up when unsure:
> MgCl2 white precipitate
- first make sure equation is correct
- ions rather than full compounds
- nitrogen cannot have 4 bonds

### Graphical mistakes:
- always look at axes and units
- Ea drawn from reactants to peak
- voltmeter drawn in cells

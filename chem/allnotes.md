# Notes from all topics

### Transition metals:
- Cr2O7^2- = orange, Cr3+ green
- Vanadium oxide for contact process
- Cu2+, Cd are toxic to env
- d block element ions with 8 electrons in d subshell form square planar
- Cr(OH)3 and Cu(OH)2 soluble in excess NH3
- others insoluble because NH3 releases OH-
- [Cr(NH3)6]3+(aq)

### Useful reactions:
- 2H+ + 2CrO4^2- => Cr2O7^2- + H2O
- 2Cu2+ + 4I- --> 2CuI + I2

### Stereoisomerism:
- cis-trans only in square and octahedral
- optical isomerism in cis-octahedral or 3 identical bidentate ligands around central ion

### Colours of complex ions:
- [Cr(H2O)6]3+ = purple
- [Cr(OH)6]3- = dark green
- Mn2+ pale pink --> Mn(OH)2 = light brown
- Fe3+ pale yellow

### Clocks reactions:
- amount of thiosulphate effectively constant -->
- rate $\propto 1/T$

### Ionic product of water:
- water only creates solution of 0.0000001 mol dm-3 OH- ions by itself

### Equivalence point:
- volume of a solution that exactly reacts with fixed volume of the other
- [HA] = [A-] --> pKa = pH

### MnO4- titrations:
- endpoint when first permanent pink colour
- ethanedioic acid in sample needs 60C activation temp

### Cells:
- primary cells flat when one reactant used up
- secondary cells recharged when current put into cell
- in fuel cells electrolyte flows in opposite direction as electrons

### Li+ cells:
- low atomic mass so light weight + high energy density
- BUT very reactive, fires. CO produced when overheated

### Organic synthesis:
- RCN -Heat/2H2O + HCl-> RCOOH + NH4Cl
- AlCl3 used for acylation and alkylation reactions
- c.HCl/Sn + RNO2 -reflux-> RNH2

### Filtration under reduced pressure:
- insoluble impurities can be filtered out
- solubility of target compound falls while impurities remain in solution when cooled

### Melting points:
- diff when melting first observed vs complete
- heating stopped when melting point approached in thiele tube

### Substitution:
- N: RX with NaCN/ NH3 in C2H5OH
- N: NaX/c.H2SO4
- N: CHOCl + NH3 -> CHONH2 + HCl
- N: alkaline hydrolysis of ester
- N: CH3Cl + NaOH -> CH3OH + NaCl
- E: acylation / alkylation / chlorination / nitration

### Addition:
- N: RCHO + NaCN/H+
- E: C=C + HX
- E: C=C + H2O/H3PO4

### Hydrolysis:
- excess of water used to favour forward reaction
- oxygen with too many bonds has $+$ charge
- hydronium catalyst
- ethanoic acid is weak so does not react with weak base

### Directing:
- lone pairs of Hal in p-orbital --> 2, 4 directing as they stabilise transition state
- halogens cannot obtain full octet through resonance on 3rd carbon
- $\mathrm{-O^-}$ strongly activating, $\mathrm{-^+NR_3}$ deactivating

### Mechanism FAX:
- tertiary haloalkane slowly ionises by itself. Cannot have normal nucleophilic attack as steric hindrance
- electronegativities of C and I are equal $\Rightarrow$ no separation of charge
- approaching negative ion causes bonding electrons to be repelled to iodine end of bond
- large bromine atom hinders attack from its side and its partial negativity repels incoming $\mathrm{Nu^-}$
- any HCl formed would immediately react with excess ammonia
- NaOH in ethanol --> alkene from haloalkane

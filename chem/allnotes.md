# Notes from all topics

### Transition metals:
- Cr2O7^2- = orange, Cr3+ green
- Vanadium oxide for contact process
- Cu2+, Cd are toxic to env
- d block element ions with 8 electrons in d subshell form square planar
- Cr(OH)3 and Cu(OH)2 soluble in excess NH3
- others insoluble because NH3 releases OH-
- [Cr(NH3)6]3+(aq)

### Useful reactions:
- 2H+ + 2CrO4^2- => Cr2O7^2- + H2O
- 2Cu2+ + 4I- --> 2CuI + I2

### Stereoisomerism:
- cis-trans only in square and octahedral
- optical isomerism in cis-octahedral or 3 identical bidentate ligands around central ion

### Colours of complex ions:
- [Cr(H2O)6]3+ = purple
- [Cr(OH)6]3- = dark green
- Mn2+ pale pink --> Mn(OH)2 = light brown
- Fe3+ pale yellow

### Clocks reactions:
- amount of thiosulphate effectively constant -->
- rate $\propto 1/T$

### Ionic product of water:
- water only creates solution of 0.0000001 mol dm-3 OH- ions by itself

### Equivalence point:
- volume of a solution that exactly reacts with fixed volume of the other
- [HA] = [A-] --> pKa = pH

### MnO4- titrations:
- endpoint when first permanent pink colour
- ethanedioic acid in sample needs 60C activation temp

### Cells:
- primary cells flat when one reactant used up
- secondary cells recharged when current put into cell
- in fuel cells electrolyte flows in opposite direction as electrons

### Li+ cells:
- low atomic mass so light weight + high energy density
- BUT very reactive, fires. CO produced when overheated

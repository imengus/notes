# Notes from all topics

### Transition metals:
- Cr2O7^2- = orange, Cr3+ green
- Vanadium oxide for contact process
- Cu2+, Cd are toxic to env
- d block element ions with 8 electrons in d subshell form square planar
- Cr(OH)3 and Cu(OH)2 soluble in excess NH3
- others insolube because NH3 releases OH-
- [Cr(NH3)6]3+(aq)

### Stereoisomerism:
- cis-trans only in square and octahedral
- optical isomerism in cis-octahedral or 3 identical bidentate ligands around central ion

### Colours of complex ions:
- [Cr(H2O)6]3+ = purple
- [Cr(OH)6]3- = dark green
- Mn2+ pale pink --> Mn(OH)2 = light brown
- Fe3+ pale yellow

### Clocks reactions:
- amount of thiosulphate effectively constant -->
- rate $\propto 1/T$
